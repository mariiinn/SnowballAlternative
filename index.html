      <h2>The sleep cycle</h2>
      <!-- https://www.britannica.com/list/9-fun-facts-about-sleep
      https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/stages-of-sleep -->
      <p>
        Our sleep cycle has four different stages that repeats about every 90
        minutes through the night. That is three NREM (Non-rapid eye movement)
        stages and a REM (Rapid eye movement) stage. The first stage (N1) is
        the "dozing off" stage. Breathing rate slows, but the body isn’t fully
        relaxed yet. In the next stage, N2 sleep, the body temperature drops,
        muscles relax and breathing becomes regular. Brain waves change and
        eye movement stops. A person typically spends around half their sleep
        time in N2 sleep. N3 is also called deep sleep or delta sleep (SWS –
        short-wave sleep). The body relaxes even further. It is believed that
        N3 sleep is critical to restorative sleep, that is sleep that allows
        the body to restore health and growth.

        Then we enter REM sleep. Breathing becomes irregular, the heart beats
        faster and the eyes moves. At this time the body experiences temporary
        paralysis which means you wouldn't actually start running if you dream
        about running. Though there is possible to dream in earlier
        stages, the dreams accumulated in this stage are more vivid and
        common.
      </p>

      <h2>REM sleep</h2>
      <!-- https://www.britannica.com/list/9-fun-facts-about-sleep -->
      <p>
        Around a quarter of the night is spent in REM sleep. A person spends
        nearly 600 hours dreaming each year during REM sleep. It is believed
        you can learn in your dreams, strengthen memory and creativity. In a
        busy world where we never have enough time, we want to exploit the
        hours spent in REM sleep to expand horizons.

      <h2>Dream manipulation today</h2>
      <!-- https://www.wikihow.com/Control-Your-Dreams -->
      <p>
        There are ways of dream manipulation today. This can be done by writing
        down or reading about what you want to dream, and then thinking about it
        while still being relaxed. Ask yourself if your dreaming. You might be
        if things that change shouldn't be able to, like for example text.
      </p>

      <h2>The future of dream manipulation</h2>
      <p>
        We want to make dream manipulation easier. Simply choose the theme for
        the night to continue the learning process while sleeping. When asleep
        the knowledge will be planted through the NREM stages such that when
        you reach the dreamstage, this is where your unconscious mind will go.
        Say you watched a scary movie and by closing your eyes, your thoughts
        drift towards what you watched. A calm theme option would make the
        process of sleep more enjoyable and effective. This could potentially
        reduce stress as well.

        The dreams can be recorded (it will remember for you) and analyzed
        afterwards if you like. The device will have an encyclopedia of dream
        theories you can look through if you want to know what your dreams
        could mean.
