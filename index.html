      <h2>The sleep cycle</h2>
      <!-- https://www.britannica.com/list/9-fun-facts-about-sleep
      https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/stages-of-sleep -->
      <p>
        Our sleep cycle has four stages that repeats about every 90
        minutes through the night. That is three NREM (Non-rapid eye movement)
        stages and a REM (Rapid eye movement) stage.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>N1</th>
          <td>
            The "dozing off" stage. Breathing rate slows, but the body isn’t
            fully relaxed yet.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>N2</th>
          <td>
            Body temperature drops, muscles relax, breathing becomes regular
            and eye movement stops. A person usually spends around half their
            sleep in N2 sleep.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <th>N3</th>
          <td>
            Also called deep sleep. The body relaxes even further. It is believed
            that the body restore health and growth in this stage.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>REM</th>
          <td>
            Breathing becomes irregular, the heart beats faster and the eyes
            moves. At this time the body experiences temporary paralysis which
            means you wouldn't actually start running if you dream about running.
            Though there is possible to dream in earlier stages, the dreams
            accumulated in this stage are more vivid and common.

      <h2>Acadreamic - the future of dream manipulation</h2>
      <p>
        Let me ask you a question; how can we take learning to the next level?
        How can we efficiently obtain knowledge in a busy world where we never
        have enough time? The answer is one of the many mysteries of the
        subconscious mind with a great potential for educational growth: dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third of our lifetime is spent sleeping
        (https://www.tempo.io/blog/7-time-consuming-things-an-average-joe-spends-in-a-lifetime),
        where nearly 600 hours every year is spent in REM sleep.
        (https://www.britannica.com/list/9-fun-facts-about-sleep).
        Some say to express unwelcome emotions and thoughts as an emotional
        outlet, solve problems, process information, strengthen memory and
        make creative connections. In other words, continue learning about
        ourselves and the world around us. All you need to optimalize
        learning while dreaming is a little guidance, a little controlled
        dream manipulation.
      </p>
      <!-- https://www.wikihow.com/Control-Your-Dreams -->
      <p>
        There are ways of dream manipulation today. This can be done by
        writing or reading about something and then thinking about it while
        still being relaxed enough to fall asleep. If you are wondering if
        you are dreaming, do a reality check. You might be if things that
        should stay constant change, like for example text.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make dream manipulation easier. The process is simple:
        put the electrodes on the sides of your forehead, choose a theme
        from our collection and relax. The idea will be planted before the
        REM stage, where the most vivid dreams occur. You will unconsciously
        continue learning about the theme of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device has a record option. The information obtained subconsciously
        will be stored and be accessible for reviewing when you wake up. You
        can choose to keep it saved or delete it. (You can turn off this
        feature in settings if you don’t want it to record at all.) This
        feature is created such that you can further ponder on thoughts and
        ideas you had while learning in your sleep. (The device has a large
        library of dream theories and will display suggestions.) Since people
        rarely remember dreams when they wake up naturally, this would eliminate
        the problem of forgetting. We don’t want to forget what we just learnt,
        would we?

      <h2>Additional features</h2>
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Many people have a hard time dozing off when going to bed. In these
        days of never-ending distractions all around us, the brain has no time
        during the day to process stuff. Therefore, when we go to bed the mind
        can’t seem to relax. This can shorten your time spent learning in your
        sleep, and lack of sleep also challenge your ability to learn when awake
        the next few days. If you have a busy mind and stressful thoughts when
        trying to fall asleep, it isn’t recommended to keep trying.
        (https://natural-alternative-therapies.com/night-anxiety-signs-symptoms-and-top-methods-to-prevent-anxiety-at-night/).
        Trying to take away attention from something is so much harder than
        giving it. Hence, give your attention to something else for a while.
        We want to give you this “something else” in form of calming music that
        redirect troubled thoughts. The music will play until the device detect
        you are asleep and then dim out. You can choose for it to detect you
        waking up as well and start playing. We have a collection of calming
        music pieces to choose from, this includes gentle sounds like rain and
        waves.
      </p>

      <h3>Lights</h3>
      <p>
        If you want some light on when going to sleep, the device can offer
        this as well. The light will turn off when you have fallen asleep
        and will turn back on when awake. You can choose between dim light
        source, starry sky projection or none in settings.

      <h2> Learning database </h2>
      <p>
        The database of learning material saved on the device will
        contain a large variety of themes. It will span from learning to speak
        for children to advanced mathematics, and everything in between.
        Follow your curiosity!
      </p>

      <p>
        The database are divided into multiple categories. The categories
        are based on different themes, such as history, politics, economics,
        languages and much more. There is a seperate category for children
        under kindergarden age. You can also use the search function and browse
        through a long list of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the features of the learning
        database is the separate categories for each schoolyear,
        based on your schools curriculum.
        Simply fill in your schools name or location, and the device will
        categorize your curriculum in order. It is perfect for students,
        from kindergarden to college. But why stop learning only because
        you graduated? The device will motivate you to keep learning as
        long and far as your imagination and curiosity takes you.
        Did you know that the learning database has so much content, it would
        take you over 200 years to go through it all even if you used it
        8 hours a day? And the database keeps growing!
