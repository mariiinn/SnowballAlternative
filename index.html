      <h3>The sleep cycle</h3>
      <p>
        Our sleep cycle has four stages that repeats about every 90 minutes
        through the night. Through the NREM (non-rapid eye movement) stages the
        breathing rate  slows, body temperature drops and the body relaxes.
        It is believed that the body restore health and growth in the third
        stage of NREM sleep. The REM (rapid eye movement) stage is commonly
        where the most vivid dreams are accumulated,
        though it is possible to dream in earlier stages as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third of our lifetime is spent sleeping <a href="sources.html">
        [Source 1]</a>, where nearly 600 hours every year is spent in REM sleep.
        <a href="sources.html">[Source 2]</a>. Some say to express unwelcome
        emotions and thoughts as an emotional outlet, solve problems, process
        information, strengthen memory and make creative connections. In other
        words, continue learning about ourselves and the world around us. All
        you need to optimalize learning while dreaming is a little guidance,
        a little controlled dream manipulation.
      </p>

      <h3>Dream manipulation</h3>
      <p>
        There are ways of dream manipulation today. This can be done by
        writing or reading about something and then thinking about it while
        still being relaxed enough to fall asleep. If you are wondering if
        you are dreaming, do a reality check. You might be if things that
        should stay constant change, like for example text.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make dream manipulation easier. The process is simple:
        put the electrodes on the sides of your forehead, choose a theme
        from our collection and relax. The idea will be planted before the
        REM stage, where the most vivid dreams occur. You will unconsciously
        continue learning about the theme of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is motivate learning and ensure quality education for all ages.
        An amazing supplement to todays education. Grow your knowledge. Evolve
        your brain.
      </p>

      <h3>Record your dreams</h3>
      <p>
        The device has a record option. The information obtained subconsciously
        will be stored and be accessible for reviewing when you wake up. You
        can choose to keep it saved or delete it. (You can turn off this
        feature in settings if you don’t want it to record at all.) This
        feature is created such that you can further ponder on thoughts and
        ideas you had while learning in your sleep. (The device has a large
        library of dream theories and will display suggestions.) Since people
        rarely remember dreams when they wake up naturally, this would eliminate
        the problem of forgetting. We don’t want to forget what we just learnt,
        would we?

        The database are divided into multiple categories. The categories

      <p>
        Many people have a hard time dozing off when going to bed. In these
        days of never-ending distractions all around us, the brain has no time
        during the day to process stuff. Therefore, when we go to bed the mind
        can’t seem to relax. This can shorten your time spent learning in your
        sleep, and lack of sleep also challenge your ability to learn when awake
        the next few days. If you have a busy mind and stressful thoughts when
        trying to fall asleep, it isn’t recommended to keep trying.
        <a href="sources.html">[Source 3]</a>.
        Trying to take away attention from something is so much harder than
        giving it. Hence, give your attention to something else for a while.
        We want to give you this “something else” in form of calming music that
        redirect troubled thoughts. The music will play until the device detect
        you are asleep and then dim out. You can choose for it to detect you
        waking up as well and start playing. We have a collection of calming
        music pieces to choose from, this includes gentle sounds like rain and
        waves.
